        <h2>Part 3: NYC Green Markets - Unique Produce Types</h2>
        <div>
            <p>As part of a homework assignment, I ask my students at Pratt to go out and chart something of interest to them, and Katherine Savarese came back with a simple chart about farmers markets that I loved- it inspired this post. </p>
            <p>You probably know that farmers markets are a staple across all five boroughs of New York City, but September happens to be a very special month. Why is that?  Well, it turns out September is the month with the most unique types of fresh produce- forty three to be exact.</p>
            <p> To show the current offerings, we charted how many types of fruits and vegetables are available by month, and showed if they were fresh or from storage.  </p>
